nearest branch above you is above your reach.
Beside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.
In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently
scavanged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, 
and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one
is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp. The egg appears extremely
fragile."""
